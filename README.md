**Laravel Sanity** is a **staging** package to assist in running your own unit testing, code standards and custom runner automation on your staging/testing environment using any deployment service that allows post-deployment webhook triggers. Ideal for start-ups or teams that prefer a simple testing environment over enterprise CI. Keep track of breakage scores and compete with your team in keeping your codebase clean!
